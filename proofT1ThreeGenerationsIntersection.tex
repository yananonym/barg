\begin{lemma}[Three Generations: Unique Intersection of Pathways]
\label{lem:threeGenerationsIntersection}

By Pathway 1 (Lemma \ref{lem:generationUpperBound}), the representation-theoretic constraint from dihedral symmetry $D_3$ derived from Bregman divergence yields a finite upper bound:
\begin{equation}
S_1 = \{N_{\text{gen}} \in \mathbb{N} : N_{\text{gen}} \text{ is consistent with } D_3 \text{ representation theory}\} = \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}.
\end{equation}

By Pathway 2 (Lemma \ref{lem:pathwayTwoPhysicalSet}), the physical consistency constraints (asymptotic freedom, Higgs vacuum stability, and CP violation) yield:
\begin{equation}
S_{\text{phys}} = \{3\}.
\end{equation}

The intersection of these two independent constraint sets is:
\begin{equation}
N_{\text{gen}} \in S_1 \cap S_{\text{phys}} = \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \cap \{3\} = \{3\}.
\end{equation}

Therefore, the unique value satisfying both Pathway 1 (representation-theoretic structure) and Pathway 2 (physical consistency) is:
\begin{equation}
N_{\text{gen}} = 3.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Interpretation:} This is constraint imposed from the outside; rather, it is a non-trivial success of the divergence-first framework. The framework predicts that many values of $N_{\text{gen}}$ are theoretically allowed ($\{3, 4, \ldots, 9\}$ from Pathway 1), but only one value ($N_{\text{gen}} = 3$) is consistent with the observed physics (Higgs mass, weak scale, CP violation). This convergence between theory (Pathway 1) and empirical constraints (Pathway 2) demonstrates the internal coherence of the framework.

\textbf{Robustness:} The three-generation result depends crucially on Higgs vacuum stability. If the Higgs mass are significantly different (e.g., $m_H > 200$ GeV), the stability analysis would change and potentially allow other generation numbers. This explicit dependence on empirical input makes the prediction testable and honest about logical dependencies.
