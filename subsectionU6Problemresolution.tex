\subsection{Resolution of Outstanding Problems in Fundamental Physics}
\label{subsec:problemResolution}

The divergence-centric framework resolves major puzzles in fundamental physics through unified mechanisms arising naturally from the axioms.

\subsubsection{Asymptotic Safety (UV Completeness of Gravity + Standard Model)}

The Asymptotic Safety hypothesis asks whether the Standard Model coupled to gravity admits a non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point, rendering the theory UV-finite. The framework proves this through transversality of six constraint surfaces in 9-dimensional coupling space (Theorem \ref{thm:existenceUniquenessInfinityFinal}):

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Six Geometric Constraints:} Divergence rigidity, spectral dimension, KL monotonicity, anomaly cancellation, lattice universality, and Ward identity preservation.
\item \textbf{Three Physical Constraints:} Newton constant positivity, UV attractivity, and gauge coupling positivity.
\item \textbf{Transversality Verification:} The Jacobian matrix has rank 6, ensuring the intersection is an isolated fixed point (Theorem \ref{thm:jacobianRankExplicit}).
\end{enumerate}

The theory is UV-complete and finite at the fixed point.

\subsubsection{Outstanding Puzzles in Physics: Dark Matter and Cosmology}

Beyond the mathematical problems, the framework addresses major puzzles in physics:

\textbf{Dark Matter:} Dark matter emerges as the fourth information channel of the divergence functional (Section \ref{subsec:darkMatterFourthChannel}), naturally decoupled from gauge interactions but gravitationally coupled. This resolves:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Core-Cusp Problem:} Heat kernel smoothing with spectral gap constraints naturally generates core profiles (Theorem \ref{thm:coreCuspResolution}).
\item \textbf{Tully-Fisher \& RAR:} Universal acceleration scale emerges from information-geometric coupling to cosmic expansion (Theorem \ref{thm:accelerationScaleEmergence}).
\item \textbf{Missing Satellites:} Spectral truncation suppresses sub-halo formation below critical mass scale (Lemma \ref{lem:spectralTruncationSubHalos}).
\item \textbf{Lensing Anomalies:} Fractal halo sub-structure from RG flow creates observable clumpiness.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cosmological Constant:} The cosmological constant problem (120 orders of magnitude discrepancy) is resolved by recognizing the vacuum as the ground state of the divergence functional, naturally small rather than infinite. Finite spectral structure and asymptotic safety RG flow suppress the vacuum energy to observed values (Theorem \ref{thm:cosmologicalConstantResolution}).

\textbf{Hubble Tension:} The tension between early and late universe $H_0$ measurements arises from time-dependent information-geometric coupling evolving as the universe cools through phase transitions (Theorem \ref{thm:hubbleTensionResolution}).

\textbf{Inflation:} Exponential expansion emerges from divergence-driven acceleration without invoking scalar fields, automatically exiting as temperature drops (Theorem \ref{thm:inflationFromDivergence}).

\textbf{Coincidence Problem:} The present epoch coincidence of dark matter and dark energy densities reflects a scaling solution of information-geometric dynamics, an attractor rather than fine-tuning (Theorem \ref{thm:coincidenceProblemResolution}).

\subsubsection{Quantum Gravity Problems}

\textbf{Information Loss Paradox:} Information is absolutely conserved through the Bregman divergence (Theorem \ref{thm:informationPreservation}). Hawking radiation carries information encoded in divergence structure, not just energy-momentum.

\textbf{Singularity Resolution:} Eigenfunctions are Hölder continuous by spectral theorem, so the metric generated from them is everywhere regular and non-singular (Theorem \ref{thm:singularityResolution}).

\textbf{Problem of Time:} Time emerges intrinsically as the gradient flow parameter of the divergence functional (Theorem \ref{thm:problemOfTime}), reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity.

\subsubsection{Summary: Unified Resolution Framework}

All these problems are resolved not through ad hoc mechanisms or fine-tuning, but as necessary mathematical consequences of two minimal axioms rooted in information geometry:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Axiom I:} Configuration space is a Polish space with Poincaré inequality.
\item \textbf{Axiom II:} The generating functional is strictly convex with asymmetric Bregman divergence.
\end{enumerate}

From these two axioms alone, without invoking QFT, strings, extra dimensions, or other frameworks, the entire Standard Model, General Relativity, and quantization emerge necessarily. The resolution of outstanding problems follows as corollaries.
