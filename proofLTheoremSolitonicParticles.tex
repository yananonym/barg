\textit{Existence:} Consider the constrained minimization:
\begin{equation}
\inf_{\|\psi\|_{L^2}^2 = Q} H_{\text{matter}}[\psi].
\end{equation}

By direct methods in calculus of variations: $H_{\text{matter}}$ is coercive in $H^{1,2}(X)$ (by polynomial growth of $U$), and the level sets are weakly closed. By compactness of the embedding $H^{1,2}(X) \hookrightarrow L^2(X, \mu)$ (Lemma \ref{lem:polishConsequences}), a minimizer exists. This minimizer is a solitonic solution with finite energy and stability by the second variation test.

\textit{Exponential Decay:} On a Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature bounded below (ensured by Einstein-Hilbert emergence), solutions to $-\Delta_g \psi + V(\psi) = 0$ with $V(\psi) \sim |\psi|^4$ exhibit exponential decay from elliptic regularity theory.

\textit{Topological Protection:} The $U(1)$ phase symmetry $\psi \to e^{i\theta} \psi$ has conserved Noether current, with integer-valued topological charge (winding number) preventing decay.

\textit{Mass Interpretation:} The energy $H_{\text{matter}}$ in the center-of-mass frame equals the rest mass. Moving solutions have energy-momentum with relativistic dispersion relation $E^2 = p^2 + M^2$.
