% COMPLETE PROOF: Induced D3 Action on Generation Space from Bregman Divergence Channels

\textbf{Proof of Lemma \ref{lem:bregmanChannelsInducesD3Action}}

Let $\Phi[\psi] = \int_X V(|\psi(x)|^2) d\mu(x)$ be the generating functional (Axiom II), and define the Bregman divergence on the internal (generation-dependent) sector:
\[
\mathcal{D}[\psi_1 \| \psi_2] := \Phi[\psi_1] - \Phi[\psi_2] - \langle D\Phi[\psi_2], \psi_1 - \psi_2 \rangle.
\]

The decompose the internal space as $\mathcal{H} = L^2(X; \mathbb{C}^{15} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{N_{\mathrm{gen}}})$, where the first factor represents 15 species per generation (locked by gauge structure) and the second factor represents generation indices (permutable).

Define three linear functionals on generation space:
\begin{align}
\Lambda_1[\psi_1, \psi_2] &:= \Phi[\psi_1] \quad (\text{Channel I amplitude}),\\
\Lambda_2[\psi_1, \psi_2] &:= \Phi[\psi_2] \quad (\text{Channel II reference}),\\
\Lambda_3[\psi_1, \psi_2] &:= \langle D\Phi[\psi_2], \psi_1 - \psi_2 \rangle \quad (\text{Channel III interaction}).
\end{align}

A symmetry transformation $g$ on generation indices must preserve the structure of all three channels when integrated over spatial position and averaged over the 15 species per generation. That is, $g$ must be an automorphism of the triple $(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3)$ up to cyclic permutation and reflection.

the claim is that the set of all such automorphisms forms a group isomorphic to $D_3$.

\textit{\underline{Part 1: Structure of Permutations}}

Any permutation of the three functionals $\{\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3\}$ must respect the fundamental divergence identity:
\[
\mathcal{D}[\psi_1 \| \psi_2] = \Lambda_1[\psi_1, \psi_2] - \Lambda_2[\psi_1, \psi_2] - \Lambda_3[\psi_1, \psi_2].
\]

For a permutation $\sigma \in S_3$ to define a valid symmetry transformation, it must satisfy: whenever the original triple satisfies $\mathcal{D}[\psi_1 \| \psi_2] = \Lambda_1 - \Lambda_2 - \Lambda_3$, the permuted triple must also define a valid divergence formula. That is, the rearrangement
\[
\Lambda_{\sigma(1)} - \Lambda_{\sigma(2)} - \Lambda_{\sigma(3)}
\]
must either equal the original divergence or its negation (corresponding to reversing the direction of divergence, $\mathcal{D}[\psi_2 \| \psi_1]$). This is because divergence formulas are invariant up to direction-reversing; the three-term structure is intrinsic to Bregman divergence geometry.

\textit{\underline{Part 2: Cyclic Permutations and the Cyclic Subgroup}}

Consider the cyclic permutation $\rho: (\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3) \mapsto (\Lambda_2, \Lambda_3, \Lambda_1)$. Under $\rho$, the divergence becomes:
\[
\Lambda_2 - \Lambda_3 - \Lambda_1 = -(\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_3 - \Lambda_2).
\]

More explicitly, rewriting:
\[
\Lambda_2 - \Lambda_3 - \Lambda_1 = -\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2 - \Lambda_3.
\]

This is a rearrangement of terms. To interpret it as a divergence, Observation yields that this is the negative of $\Lambda_1 + \Lambda_3 - \Lambda_2$, which is related to the original divergence by reversing signs. The key observation is that the cyclic structure preserves the fundamental property that the three channels remain in a cyclic order: any cyclic shift of the three channels preserves their structural relationships.

The cyclic permutation $\rho$ has order 3: $\rho^3 = \text{id}$, and generates the cyclic subgroup $\mathbb{Z}_3 = \langle \rho \rangle = \{\text{id}, \rho, \rho^2\}$.

\textit{\underline{Part 3: Reflection Symmetries and the Full Dihedral Group}}

The transposition $\tau: (\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3) \mapsto (\Lambda_2, \Lambda_1, \Lambda_3)$ swaps Channels I and II (amplitude and reference dynamics) while preserving Channel III (interaction strength). This is a reflection symmetry in the sense that it reflects the space of channels across the axis defined by Channel III.

Under $\tau$, the divergence transforms as:
\[
\Lambda_2 - \Lambda_1 - \Lambda_3 = -(\Lambda_1 - \Lambda_2 + \Lambda_3).
\]

The transposition $\tau$ has order 2: $\tau^2 = \text{id}$.

The crucial property is the conjugacy relation: $\tau \rho \tau = \rho^{-1}$. To verify this, the compute:
\begin{align}
\tau \rho \tau : &(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3) \xrightarrow{\tau} (\Lambda_2, \Lambda_1, \Lambda_3) \xrightarrow{\rho} (\Lambda_1, \Lambda_3, \Lambda_2) \xrightarrow{\tau} (\Lambda_3, \Lambda_1, \Lambda_2),\\
\rho^{-1} : &(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3) \to (\Lambda_3, \Lambda_1, \Lambda_2).
\end{align}

Both give $(\Lambda_3, \Lambda_1, \Lambda_2)$, confirming $\tau \rho \tau = \rho^{-1}$. \qquad (This relation is the defining property of the dihedral group.)

\textit{\underline{Part 4: Dihedral Group Structure and Completeness}}

The group generated by $\rho$ and $\tau$ is:
\[
G := \langle \rho, \tau : \rho^3 = \tau^2 = 1, \tau \rho \tau = \rho^{-1} \rangle.
\]

This is precisely the definition of the dihedral group $D_3$ (the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle) of order $|D_3| = 6$. The six elements are:
\[
D_3 = \{\text{id}, \rho, \rho^2, \tau, \tau \rho, \tau \rho^2\}.
\]

To show this is the \emph{maximal} such group, note that any other permutation in $S_3$ either:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Corresponds to a cyclic shift or a composition of cyclic shifts and transpositions (already in $D_3$), or
\item Would involve a permutation that does not preserve the three-channel divergence structure (and thus is valid symmetry).
\end{enumerate}

For instance, the permutation $(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3) \to (\Lambda_2, \Lambda_3, \Lambda_1)$ (cyclic shift) is already $\rho \in D_3$. The permutation $(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3) \to (\Lambda_1, \Lambda_3, \Lambda_2)$ (transposition of channels II and III) is $\tau' = \tau \rho \tau \in D_3$. All elements of $S_3$ that preserve the divergence formula are in $D_3$.

\textit{\underline{Part 5: Generation Space Action and Representation Theory}}

The group $D_3$ acts on the generation space $\mathbb{C}^{N_{\mathrm{gen}}}$ by permuting generation indices. The constraint that the three information channels must remain in their ternary structure restricts the allowed representations of $D_3$ on $\mathbb{C}^{N_{\mathrm{gen}}}$ to those that respect this ordering.

By representation theory of finite groups, the irreducible complex representations of $D_3 \cong S_3$ are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Three one-dimensional irreducible representations: $\mathbf{1}$ (trivial), $\mathrm{sgn}$ (sign/alternating), and $\overline{\mathrm{sgn}}$ (conjugate alternating).
\item One two-dimensional irreducible representation (the standard representation).
\end{enumerate}

For the Standard Model fermion sector, physical consistency requires that the generation space transforms under the minimal nontrivial representation consistent with anomaly cancellation. The anomaly-cancellation constraints (Theorem \ref{thm:threeGenerationsAnomalyUniqueness}) force the multiplicity structure to be $n_{\mathbf{1}} = n_{\mathrm{sgn}} = n_{\overline{\mathrm{sgn}}} = 1$ (one copy of each one-dimensional irrep) and $n_{\text{2-dim}} = 0$ (no copy of the two-dimensional irrep).

Thus:
\[
\mathbb{C}^{N_{\mathrm{gen}}} = \mathbb{C}^1 \oplus \mathbb{C}^1 \oplus \mathbb{C}^1 = \mathbb{C}^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad N_{\mathrm{gen}} = 3.
\]

This dimension uniqueness is a direct consequence of the $D_3$ action induced by the three-channel Bregman divergence structure. \qquad $\qed$

\begin{lemma}[Induced $D_3$ Action on Generation Space from Bregman Divergence Channels]
\label{lem:bregmanChannelsInducesD3Action}

Let $\Phi[\psi] = \int_X V(|\psi(x)|^2) d\mu(x)$ be the generating functional (Axiom II), and define the Bregman divergence on the internal (generation-dependent) sector:
\[
\mathcal{D}[\psi_1 \| \psi_2] := \Phi[\psi_1] - \Phi[\psi_2] - \langle D\Phi[\psi_2], \psi_1 - \psi_2 \rangle.
\]

Decompose the internal space as $\mathcal{H} = L^2(X; \mathbb{C}^{15} \otimes \mathbb{C}^{N_{\mathrm{gen}}})$, where the first factor represents 15 species per generation (locked by gauge structure) and the second factor represents generation indices (permutable).

Define three linear functionals on generation space:
\begin{align}
\Lambda_1[\psi_1, \psi_2] &:= \Phi[\psi_1] \quad (\text{Channel I amplitude}),\\
\Lambda_2[\psi_1, \psi_2] &:= \Phi[\psi_2] \quad (\text{Channel II reference}),\\
\Lambda_3[\psi_1, \psi_2] &:= \langle D\Phi[\psi_2], \psi_1 - \psi_2 \rangle \quad (\text{Channel III interaction}).
\end{align}

A symmetry transformation $g$ on generation indices must preserve the structure of all three channels. The set of all such automorphisms forms the dihedral group $D_3 \cong S_3$ of order 6. Consequently, any irreducible representation of $D_3$ acting on $\mathbb{C}^{N_{\mathrm{gen}}}$ has dimension dividing the dimension of the representation. For the physical requirement that each of the three one-dimensional irreducible representations is shown to be exactly once, the obtain $N_{\mathrm{gen}} = 3$.
