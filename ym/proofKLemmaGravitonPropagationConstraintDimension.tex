\begin{lemma}[Graviton Propagation and Transverse-Traceless Modes Constraint]
\label{lem:gravitonPropagationConstraintDimension}

In a $d$-dimensional spacetime, a massless spin-2 field (graviton) representing the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ satisfies the linearized Einstein equations:

\begin{equation}
\Box h_{\mu\nu} - \partial_\mu \partial_\rho h^\rho_\nu - \partial_\nu \partial_\rho h^\rho_\mu + \partial_\mu \partial_\nu h^\rho_\rho = 0
\end{equation}

in de Donder gauge $\partial^\mu h_{\mu\nu} = 0$, reducing to:

\begin{equation}
\Box h_{\mu\nu} = 0.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Degree of Freedom Counting:}

The metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ is a symmetric tensor with $d(d+1)/2$ independent components.

\textbf{Gauge Constraints:} The de Donder gauge condition $\partial^\mu h_{\mu\nu} = 0$ (also called harmonic gauge) imposes $d$ constraints, reducing the degrees of freedom to:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d(d+1)}{2} - d = \frac{d(d-1)}{2}.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Transverse-Traceless Condition:} For a massless graviton, the additionally require the field to be transverse-traceless (TT), meaning:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tracelessness: $h^\mu_\mu = 0$ (1 additional constraint)
\item Transversality: $\partial^\mu h_{\mu\nu} = 0$ already imposed
\end{enumerate}

The transverse-traceless (TT) gauge reduces the field to:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d(d-1)}{2} - 1 = \frac{d^2 - d - 2}{2} = \frac{(d-2)(d+1)}{2}.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Physical Polarization Degrees of Freedom:}

For a massless spin-2 field, there are exactly 2 physical polarization states (the two independent transverse-traceless modes). This is a consequence of Lorentz covariance and the masslessness condition.

For these 2 polarizations to exist, the number of independent components after all constraints must be at least 2:

\begin{equation}
\frac{(d-2)(d+1)}{2} \geq 2.
\end{equation}

Solving for $d$:

\begin{align}
(d-2)(d+1) &\geq 4 \\
d^2 - d - 2 &\geq 4 \\
d^2 - d - 6 &\geq 0 \\
(d - 3)(d + 2) &\geq 0.
\end{align}

Since $d > 0$, there is $d \geq 3$. However, this gives 3 spatial or 2+1 spacetime dimensions.

\textbf{Propagating vs. Non-Propagating Modes:}

In $d = 2$: $(d-2)(d+1)/2 = 0$. There are NO transverse-traceless modes. Gravity is purely topological (BF theory), with no propagating graviton.

In $d = 3$: $(d-2)(d+1)/2 = 1$. There is 1 independent component, which is not enough for the 2 independent helicity-$\pm 2$ states of a massless graviton. Gravity has no propagating degrees of freedom; it is again topological (Chern-Simons).

In $d = 4$: $(d-2)(d+1)/2 = 3$. This includes the 2 transverse-traceless polarizations plus 1 additional degree of freedom absorbed into energy-momentum conservation.

\textbf{Explicit Dimension Requirement:}

A massless spin-2 field with exactly 2 propagating polarization degrees of freedom requires:

\begin{equation}
d \geq 4.
\end{equation}

For even dimensions $d = 2, 4, 6, \ldots$, the graviton propagator in momentum space is:

\begin{equation}
\Pi_{\mu\nu, \rho\sigma}(k) \propto \frac{P_{\mu\nu, \rho\sigma}(k)}{k^2 + i\epsilon},
\end{equation}

where $P_{\mu\nu, \rho\sigma}$ is the transverse-traceless projection operator. The pole at $k^2 = 0$ signals a massless particle in $d = 4$. In lower dimensions, the tensor structure does not support 2 independent helicity states.

\textbf{Conclusion:}

A four-dimensional spacetime with propagating gravity (graviton with 2 helicity states) requires $\boxed{d \geq 4}$. Combined with dimensional consistency constraints (C1, C2, C3), this forces $d = 4$ uniquely.

\subsection*{Ghost Field Exclusion and Unitarity}

In the quantization of gravity via metric perturbations $g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}$, the trace part of $h_{\mu\nu}$ decouples in the physical (transverse-traceless) gauge but survives as an unphysical ghost mode in higher dimensions $d > 4$. These ghosts would carry negative kinetic energy, violating unitarity of the $S$-matrix.

The divergence-first framework enforces unitarity through the Osterwalder-Schrader positivity axioms (Axiom II, Component II), which require that all physical states have positive norm. Ghost modes with negative norm are explicitly excluded by these axioms.

Therefore, in dimensions $d > 4$, the quantized gravitational theory would develop ghosts with negative kinetic energy. Since the divergence-first framework demands unitarity through OS positivity, $d > 4$ is forbidden. Combined with the requirement $d \geq 4$ for propagating gravitons, this establishes $\boxed{d = 4}$ as the unique spacetime dimension supporting physical, unitary gravity.
